### so we've got all the raw data, just got to join it up. we need the following:
### file that runs through the standard procedure for each week
source('c:/research/lineup/ffDataJoining/data-joining-startup.r')
ffDataJoining:::CombineWhoscoredGameByGameDataForSeason(currentseason)
gbgdf = ffDataJoining:::LoadGbgWithoutAppearanceDF()
## but that doesn't have any player ids attached to it. we want to join that to appearancedf in any case
appearanceDF = ffDataJoining:::LoadSoccerwayData()
appearanceDF %>% qview()
gbgdf %>% qv
gbgdf %>% qview()
gbgdf %>% nrow
gbgdf %>% distinct(team, player, date) %>% nrow
gbgdf %>% distinct(team, whoscoredplayer, date) %>% nrow
appearanceDF %>% qview()
appearanceDF %>% nrow
appearanceDF %>% distinct(date, team, playerid) %>% nrow
## so we firstly update all the files on disk giving the details of the player maps:
ffDataJoining:::UpdateSoccerwayWhoscoredPlayerMap(appearanceDF)
### and having done that, we now load in all of the player map data:
playerResultDF = ffDataJoining:::MergeSoccerwayWhoscoredGameData(appearanceDF, gbgdf)
ffDataJoining:::UpdateCurrentSeasonPlayerId(playerResultDF)
ffDataJoining:::MatchFFPlayerData()
