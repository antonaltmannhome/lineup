### easily made mistakes:

### transferring a player without checking current fixture is better than outgoing player's
### around xmas time, hold back transfers as much as possible, don't want to get left with injured player while rotation common. problem is it's still not worth taking the hit even when you find out so you end up fielding 9 players possibly. remember illness as well as rotation are possibilities
### if you have premium gk, is it worth signing a solid backup?
### if you can't quite afford to make the desired transfer, it's rarely the best thing to make half the transfer have a massive amount of money in the bank. you can instead downtrade on a separate player to free up the funds then make the desired transfer the next week
